<h3>Calculating the Maximum Edge of a Triangle</h3>
<div class='help_summary'>
    <p>
    According to the first triangle inequality theorem the lengths 
    of any two sides of a triangle must add up to more than the length of the third side.
    So if side a = 2 and side b = 3 the third side can't be greater than a + b - 1 (4)
    otherwise you break physics.
